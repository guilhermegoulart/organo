# This is my First React Project

I made him with the help of a React course in Alura Online Programming School

# Main Steps

Even now the new documentation from React: https://react.dev/
does not recommend anymore, use the create-react-app,
that was the comand that we use to start our project.

# What is React.js

Well, from my first time user experience, it's a single page aplication library, wait,
let me explain this better. React is a Library from JavaScript to build modern web aplications,
more knowed as Single Page Aplication, who beyond others things, React is a componnent drive library.

He uses JSX files, to alow us use HTML Tags in JavaScript code, there's some rules like use fragments: 
<>
<h1>
    This is a Example of JSX sintax
</h1>
<p>As you can se</p>
</>

The way we take all this components splited in diferent files 
and sometimes directories it's amazing, basicaly we can export tho,
as a const, or as a function, and them could be export in two ways:
by default 'export defaut funtion' or just a module 'export function'.

# Added  in Project

Well I see many times on YouTube, BootCamps, and searching on web;
many developers stylizing his components using Tailwind, and as mencioned before, 
the new documentation of React now recommend the use of Tailwind.
 So I have decided to use in my project, an it's more simple to config that I imagine
 and in my opnion turn more easy the way we add styles to our componnents.

 If you want to use in your project too, checkout the Tailwind docs: 
 https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

# Deploy

I use git as a version control manager and...
I will deploy tha aplication on Vercel and put the link down here:

I hope this Readme.md helped you to understand more about React and this project
Thanks for reading!

# For you know more:

React is much more than just a popular Single Page application library from JavaScript, 
take a look in the docs and see all the power of React.
